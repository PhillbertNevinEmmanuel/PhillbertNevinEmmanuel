### I'm still tinkering and figuring things out, but things usually go my way. 
# Hi! I'm Phillbert Nevin Emmanuel, a data enthusiast


I love working with data, databases and visualization tools. I'm Familiar with most analytical tools such as:
* Python and its Data Analytics libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
* Relational Databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL and Microsoft SQL
* Non-Relational Databases such as MongoDB
* Data Visualization Tools: Power BI, Tableau and Looker



I'm currently focusing on my Data Cleaning and Validation skills with Python Pandas and Data Engineering tools Tensorflow and Spark
